## What is playlistdata.com?

Ever wondered how long it would exactly take to complete the longest playlist on YouTube by altering the playback speed. We have got just the right thing for you!!

Playlist Data Fetcher is a simple web-app which extracts the metadata of the YouTube playlist entered by the user and provides useful data in terms of playlist length, total videos in the playlist, the duration needed to complete the playlist if playback speed is altered to either 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75 or 2x.

While planning for any video it is often necessary to look into the time constraint. Thus this data would prove to be extremely useful for content creators.
